# ReadMe

This will be an e-commerce website for selling posters and will be called Poster King.  The website will be a site where users can browse through different posters and will be able to purchase them. The website will be sports posters at the start but I have the option down the line to add different categories.

The website will have a login page which will then bring them to the main shopping page where they will be able to browse through all the products or select from different categories. Once a user adds their product to the basket then they will be able to purchase them entering in delivery and payment details. The user will also be able to see what they have purchased in the past where it will be linked to their username. If the customer currently does not have an account then they will be able to create one. When they create an account, they will also be able to change email, password and other details related to their account.

# UX
This website is based for people of all ages who like collecting sports posters. There is a big demand for posters for people to frame and to put up on theirs walls.

The posters on the site will be for combat sports fans so I will have a variation of UFC, WWE and Boxing posters as there is a big fan base for all 3 sports which I am also a fan of.

I will design the website in a king theme with red and gold. I want to use them colour in different area of the site but not too much as I don’t want to overdo it with them colours. I also want to use the Grandstander font on most of the site as it’s a font I like and think it will suit the theme of the site well.

## Features to implement in the future
* I would set up a product management system where I would be able to modify posters in the front end instead of using the back end. I would have a sections for adding, editing and deleting posters.
* I would like to add more categories of posters instead of just focusing in on sports movies. I would like to expand into movie posters as I know this is a very popular market.
* I would also like to add more sizes in the future to the posters. At the minute I have decided to just have a default size but I have left the code in for sizes so in the future it will be easier for me to add it in.
* I have also decided to name the items products instead of poster as in the future if I decided to add products that are not posters then I wont have to change it everywhere

## Technologies Used
* I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages.
* I used Gitpod (https://gitpod.io/) to build the website.
* I used Django as I want to create a python based web framework for this project.
* I used Django-Allauth (https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for the authentication system of the project and has the features I need for the site
* I used Django Crispy Forms to helps to manage the forms and able adjust forms properties in the backend.
* I used Django Countries which was used for the country field for user to be able to selct the contry they are from.
* I used Stripe to set up the payment methods for the site as customer can pay by card
* I used Bootstrap for responsive simplistic layouts.
* I used Pillow to be able to use the image field for the products on the site.
* I used JQuery (https://jquery.com/) for the JavaScript in the website
* I used Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com) to add the icons used in the site
* Block templates were used so I don’t have to repeat my code to save time
* I used Amazon AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/) for storing media and static files for use on my Heroku site
* I used autopep8 (https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) to tidy up my python code
* I used SQLite 3 for the database which stores the information from my site e.g. products, users
* Other technologies used can be found in my [Requirements](https://github.com/cfaulkner985/poster-king/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.

## Testing
Testing was done on a seperate document which is: [Testing.md](https://github.com/cfaulkner985/poster-king/blob/master/TESTING.md)

## Deployment
This project was developed using the GitPod (https://gitpod.io/) and was committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the built in function within GitPod.
In GitHub the repository is cfaulkner985/poster-king (https://github.com/cfaulkner985/poster-king). 

Below is the way to deploy the files to Github:
1. Log into GitHub. 
2. From the list of repositories on the screen, select ‘cfaulkner985/poster-king’
3. From the menu items near the top of the page, select ‘Settings’.
4. Scroll down to the ‘GitHub Pages’ section.
5. Under ‘Source’ click the drop-down menu labelled ‘None’ and select ‘Master Branch’
6. On selecting Master Branch the page is automatically refreshed, the website is now deployed. 
7. Scroll back down to the ‘GitHub Pages’ section to retrieve the link to the deployed website.

Below is the way to deploy the files to Heroku:
1. From by GitPod terminal I log into my Heroku account by typing in 'heroku login' and press return .
2. I then press any key on the keyboard to continue and it will log me into my heroku account.
3. Also from the GitPod terminal I push the files to Heroku by typing in 'git push heroku master'.
4. From heroku I click on my project which is 'poster-king'.
5. I then click on Deploy which is a tab along the top.
6. From this page I scroll down to the bottom and click on 'Deploy Branch' and make sure 'master' is selected.
7. After this is then lets me know it is seccessfully deployed and can be found at (https://poster-king.herokuapp.com/).

## Setting up Heroku
I went to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to set up an app 'Poster King'

### Heroku Postgres
- On Gitpod console install dj-database-url: ` pip3 install dj-database-url`. This package allows connection to a database URL.
- Then install psycopg2  `pip3 install psycopg2` which allows connection to the postgres database.
- Create a requirements.txt file  ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```
**import dj_database_url** at top of settings.py file and change default sqlite3 database to be default dj_database_url
```DATABASES = { 'default' :dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')) }```
Add DATABASE_URL config vars code to env.py 
Make migrations to migrate all files to new database.

```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate

```

Create new superuser via ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` and add username, email and password.
This will be production database for deploying on Heroku

Ensure Heroku has all Config Vars required = SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and set to 1 this will disable staticfiles from being added to Heroku meaning can use AWS bucket.
To allow deployment via github automatic/manual select Deploy> GitHub> connect to repo = 'ecommerce' in Heroku menu. For automatic deployment select button 'enable automatic deploys'.
Otherwise use manual deployment to 'deploy branch'.

## Committing files to GitHub
When I make changes to each file I push them from GitHub from GitPod and below are the steps I do to do this. This is essential as to not losing any of the work I have done.
1.	On my GitPod project scroll down and click on the command prompt at the bottom.
2. Check status by typing in ‘git status’.
3.	Type ‘git add’ to add the files for staging.
4.	Type ‘git commit -m "Add all files" to commit the files.
5.	Type ‘git push’ to push the files to GitHub.
